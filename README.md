# FDUSD-grid
The  quantification strategy is targeting FDUSDUSDT, due to it's a stable coin which oscillates around 1. And Bianance is selected as trading platform. Instead of using binance package, in order to improve code scalability across different trading platforms, choose ccxt package as the trading package. 

This project would share some existing bugs and give related debug method. Also, some pandas grammer would be shared for newly programmer like me.
